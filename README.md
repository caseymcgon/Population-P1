# Population-P1
Our group is primarily interested in the effects of government policies aimed at influencing fertility rates (and, as a result, total population).

Specifically, we will look into 2 countries with a history of trying to lower fertility rates:

China -- One Child Policy ('79)

India -- National Population Policy ('00)

and 3 countries with a history of trying to raise fertility rates:

Japan -- regional policies to pay families for having children (need dates)

Italy -- Fully paid leave for new fathers ('12)

Russia -- Maternity Capital Program (tax-breaks) ('07)
