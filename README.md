# Population-P1
Our group is primarily interested in the effects of government policies aimed at influencing fertility rates (and, as a result, total population).


To investigate, we wrote 5 seperate jupyter notebook (.ipnyb) files. They are (in the order you should open them):

1. **[#A] Population Dataframe and Function.ipynb** -- this notebook has 2 seperate functions. The first allows us to answer the question "In [year] how many [people/males/females] aged [low] to[high] were living in [the world/region/country]?" The second creates the Dataframe that the first function relies upon.

2. **AnimatedPopPyramid.ipnyb** -- This notebook has the code for both a stationary (see 1 input year) population pyramid AND the code for an animated (see >1 input year) population pyramid. 

3. **Historical Policies that Influence Population** -- This notebook goes in depth with graphs and written explanations linking country's policy choices to their population results. We look into 5 specific countries that have unique histories of attempted population control.

4. **Agriculture_and_Population_Graphs** -- this notebook allows us to look into the relationship between agricultural production and population over the last 70 years for the countries we are interested in

5. **Project 1 - Other Visualizations.ipnyb** -- this has bar and line graphs that allow us to see the Total Population, Percentage of Seniors in the Population, and the Population growth rates

Specifically, we will look into 2 countries with a history of trying to lower fertility rates:

1. China -- One Child Policy ('79)

2. India -- National Population Policy ('00)

and 3 countries with a history of trying to raise fertility rates:

1. Japan -- Regional policies to pay families for having children ('99)

2. Italy -- Fully paid leave for new fathers ('12)

3. Russia -- Maternity Capital Program (tax-breaks) ('07)
